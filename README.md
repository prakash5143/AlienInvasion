# AlienInvasion
Alien Invasion from "Python Crash Course - A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming" by Eric Matthes (https://www.nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse). My code is only compatible with python3. 

# Planned updates:
* Add quit button.
* Add new shortcuts. In particular:
    * h,l for left and right movements.
    * b for special bullets
    * g or mouseclick for pause. 
* Add special bullets.
* Save high score.
* Help Menu


# Known Problem
* If you recieve a fatal error trying to use pygame with python3, it is because there is a file in the wrong place. Navigate to your pygames/lib and copy freesansbold.ttf. Then navigate to python3.X/site-packages/pygame and paste freesansbold.ttf into this file. If you are having a hard time finding these locations, you should get an error pointing you to these folders.
